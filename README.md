## PROJECT ABSTRACT

Question: How does one measure the value of community interactions and accurately gauge “reputation” of a community as evident from qualitative sentiment?

To answer this question, we must understand the interpersonal relationships of communities. Each individual tends to identify oneself to a specific group and develop associativity towards their group. As members, they gradually develop trust, encourage cooperation and become mutually codependent. These measures of connectivity are identified by a Social currency. 

Social Currency Metrics System is a theory to measure these sentiments in the community called social currencies. Social currency metric system is basically a qualitative data collection, processing and measurement system. It aims to make sense of the data already available in the form of daily interactions and help the community to rely more on community sentiment. 

Collecting and processing all the data like emails, comments, issues, pull requests, tweets etc will allow community leaders to make key quality decisions regarding transparency and actionability of open source project health. Data is tagged with respect to social currency constructs like Merit, Trust, Transparency, Utility, Consistency. By implementing SCMS, we will be able to quantitatively measure the reputation of communities and the overall health of a project.

Community sentiment is based on the opinions and expectations of community members which is very important for framing decisions. Member input in essential decisions to public health is very important and thus, helps in better decisions which in turn help in the better framework and execution. By Implementing Social Currency Metric System, we will be able to measure the value of community interactions to accurately gauge the ‘reputation’ of a community.
