GSoC Meetings

GSoC 2020: Implement the Social Currency Metrics System in GrimoireLab

Coding period 2: Week 5

1. Discussion about the previous week
   1. OSS summit 
   2. Having author information into enrichers.
   3. Dashboard formation

2. Discussions
   1. Does the author name and domain recognised as PII
      1. Not really, we won’t have to worry about it too much, we could though show some hash in place of the name (depends on the community)
   2. ‘Weight’ 
      1. Weight on the basis of “Relevance” is better for grimoirelab
      2. “Positive or negative sentiments ” scaling will not yield much data
      3. Use -3 to +3 scale
      4. Typically, weight is decided in collaboration meetings after observing trends
   3. Process of Adding ‘Weight’
      1. Possibility 1: Weight added as Tags were added
      2. Possibility 2: Weight is added as a filter using Elastic Search.
      3. See the possibility of both the ways.
   4. Structure of the dashboard
      1. Having a record at the end of the dashboard.

3. Next steps, action items, and tasks
   1. IRC data merge (enrich+study)+ IRC visualisations
   2. Add random weights and random categories. 
   3. Add visualisation for weights and categories.
   4. Have a solid block in the header for SCMS.
   5. Have 250 manually tagged dataset ready to be visualised and have a collaboration meeting for it.
