GSoC Meetings

GSoC 2020: Implement the Social Currency Metrics System in GrimoireLab

Coding period 1: Week 4


1. Discussion about the previous week
   1. Made visualisations taking randomly tagged data
   2. Made observations and inferences about the trends obtained from tagging the dummy data.


2. Collaboration meeting
   1. Most frequent trend and why?
      1. Technical Service and utility: most observed
      2. GrimoireLab provides a toolkit used for software development analytics.
   2. Noise observed(untaggable records)
      1. “abc_is now known as xyz”
      2. “ChanServ sets mode: +o collabot`”
   3. Category
      1. Troubleshooting: split to “Asking for help”, “receiving help”
      2. Payment/price and physical service: removed as categories
      3. Three categories namely “Interpersonal”, “operational”, “transactional” are to be added.


3. Q/A
   1. How to tackle biased data
      1. Adding other data sources like twitter 
      2. Having a “channel” attribute helps us to visualise data in this form only. This can help in grouping similar outcomes.
   2. Addition of weight in the data. 
      1. Weight depending on positive or negative sentiments.
      2. Weight depending on the importance of a comment to the community.


4. Technical Mentor assistance and conversation (Valerio) 
   1. How should a dashboard look like? 
      1. Possible Visualizations could be on the basis of weight, author, channel, tags, category etc.
      2. It should be dynamic, selecting a specific channel, should yield visualisations with respect to that channel.


5. Next steps, action items, and tasks
   1. Making a dashboard
   2. Set up the SCMS datasheet by including random categories and using a score/weight parameter.
   3. If time permits, we could see the possibility of adding another channel.
