GSoC Meetings

GSoC 2020: Implement the Social Currency Metrics System in GrimoireLab

Coding period 2: Week 6

1. Discussion about the previous week
   1. Tests for all enrichers
   2. Converted CHAOSS data into a Google Sheet
   3. Made the required changes in  the dashboard
   4. Documentation flow: https://github.com/ria18405/Working-Directory/blob/master/README.md

2. Discussion
   1. Web app to use SCMS
      1. This could be started if we have some time left in our hands after the implementation of SCMS is over.
      2. Could be followed as an extension to SCMS in later phases.
   2. Dynamic Changes in Google Sheets, getting reflected in the Dashboard automatically.
   3. Moving forward with 2 case studies(CHAOSS and Mautic community), and will be providing concrete documentation for the user/contributor.Also includes making more scms specific enrichers.
      1. This is the plan which is finalised for the gsoc timeline. 
   4. Tagging automatically using a trained model accuracy
      1. Possibility of low accuracy
      2. Possibility of not tagging it appropriately because that trend wasn’t visible in the training set.

3. Next steps, action items, and tasks
   1. Laying off detailed steps for a user to contribute, and increasing User experience through it. 
   2. Writing some tests, code polishing
   3. Making enrichers for data sources discussed with the chaoss community manager
