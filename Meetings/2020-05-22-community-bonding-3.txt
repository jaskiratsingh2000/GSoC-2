GSoC Meetings
GSoC 2020: Implement the Social Currency Metrics System in GrimoireLab

Community Bonding Meeting 3
1. Discussion about the previous week
   1. Implemented a working SCMS on Airtable using collecting Tweets of Amazon. Just for the initial setup, used a small database i.e around 10-15 records. https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invQFOadd977DciQ9&inviteToken=a8c0122f29ed1f6fe896348fc45bbacfbdeffacd7232852c25a415eef3e57ca7 
      1. Defined a Communication Trace : Twitter, can be extended to include more platforms.
      2. Defined meaningful codex 
      3. Tagged data on the basis of Utility, Trust, Transparency, Consistency, Merit
   2. A pilot study towards Implementation Sketch (Working Directory=https://github.com/ria18405/Working-Directory )
      1. Created a new enricher for mbox (ScmsMboxEnricher)
      2. Changing the attributes of data present like SubjectAnalysed-> Scms_Subject_Analysed or Body_Extract -> Scms_Body_Extract
      3. Set mailing list and its path in projects.json 
      4. Create a new pipermail enricher inheriting from scmsmbox
      5. Remove all data except the 5-6 attributes mentioned i.e uuid,project,project_1,grimoire-creationdate,origin, Subject_analysed and Body_extract
      6. Execute micro-mordred to collect and enrich data from mbox.
      7. Dump the enriched data to an ElasticSearch index
      8. Make a script ES2Excel which will place all attributes of data received in different columns of the excel.
      9. Output=https://github.com/ria18405/Working-Directory/blob/master/output.csv 


2. Delve into Standard implementation SCMS data ria has collected over the past week to emulate traditional SCMS meeting (10 minutes)
   1. Add other platforms like Google reviews/youtube etc for data collection which focuses on general comments (for all products) of Amazon 


3. Training by Venia or Dylan on new aspects of the SCMS (10-15 minutes)
   1. Implementation of SCMS 


4. feedback / questions / updates on SCMS project (10 minutes)
   1. What is the weight of a comment and how is it implemented?
      1. A weight refers to “how important a comment is to the community”. It's generally considered at a scale of -3 to 3. So a weight 0 would mean neutral and more negatives would imply that this specific comment/sentiment is not so much important to the community.
   2. Is score calculated via measuring the tags ?
      1. The implementation of Score and weights is not very rigid and can be modified as per requirements.
      2. Score is not measured directly by tags, but also by measuring how important the comment is.
      3. Detailed explanation will be given in the next training session.


5. Technical Mentor assistance and conversation (Valerio) 
   1. How do we tackle multiple sentiments in one text.
      1. We can divide each text into multiple sentiments ensuring that the context does not get lost.
      2. Dividing the text into different sentences could possibly do that. So to avoid this we can have a small ‘+’ icon which could combine 2/more texts together, which could help in retaining the context and getting rid of the noise.
      3. Spreadsheets are a basic version of such an implementation, we could possibly look at MaxQDA where there is a much more systematic way of handling such case scenarios.


6. Next steps, action items, and tasks
   1. Advance on the elk implementation and target github issue and comments.
   2. Try to implement sentence or paragraph breaks, retaining the context.(Possible implementation could be to try and weave NLTK)
   3. Look for other implementations like MaxQDA or figure out a way to do the same in Airtable/google sheets.
   4. Personal implementation of  a small scale SCMS system with Google reviews/others added and tagged
