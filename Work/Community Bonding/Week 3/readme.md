#### Week 3 : SUMMARY -

1. Extracted interesting comics data from marvel API by making a new Perceval Backend. Understanding the interaction between Perceval and ELK. [Repository](https://github.com/ria18405/grimoirelab-perceval/)

2. Made a new branch for scms implementations(gsoc-scms) on my fork of the repository grimoirelab-elk. It helps in easy tracking of the changes. Started working on Github enricher to extract comments. (https://github.com/ria18405/grimoirelab-elk/tree/gsoc-scms)
