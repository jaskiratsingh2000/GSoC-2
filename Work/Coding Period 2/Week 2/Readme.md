## Phase 2: Coding Period 2

#### Week 6 : SUMMARY -

1. Wrote tests for all enrichers

2. Collected all CHAOSS community interactions data, and converted it into a Google Sheets. It includes all conversations from github issues and pull requests (accross different project repositories), mailing lists, IRC channel. The project.json file can be found [here](projects.json).The Google Sheet containing 67k+ records can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wXBO-Xvgm7qWcgqDSMBfnXhUMEMX3N-zQEnnGZeQktE/edit?usp=sharing).

3. Made the required changes in some visualisations in the dashboard. 

4. Made a rough documentation of the steps involved in using SCMS. I have divided the process into 2 parts, one includes the convertion of Enriched index to a Google Sheet. And the Second part involves the convertion of Google Sheet into a Dashbaord. 
Markdown for documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ria18405/Working-Directory/blob/master/README.md).
