## Phase 1: Coding Period 1 

#### Week 4 : SUMMARY -

1. Manually tagging the dataset on the basis of five metrics namely "transparency", "utility", "consistency", "merit", "trust" to observe trends.


2. Modifying the codex to incorporate the "category". Decided which all categories to be used and their use cases.


3. Made some basic visualisations for the randomly tagged dataset. It included a pie chart of 5 different tags, the number of occurences of al tags was approximately the same because of the usage of the 'random' function in python to tag the dataset. It also included a bar chart of the number of comments received per week, data indicating the number of conversations from different channels etc. I'll be making a full dashboard in the next week.
